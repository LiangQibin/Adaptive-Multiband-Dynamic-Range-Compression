# Frequency based Adaptive Wide Dynamic Range Compression

## Overview
What is the application?
Purpose of the application is to make a graphical user interface with Dynamic Range Compression parameters, to give user the freedom. User can set the compression paramters for both the ear seperately according to his hearing thresholds.
User will have the freedom of changing the parameters based on their listening preferences. Application gives the choice for bilateral compression, hearing aid fitting stratergy.

> **Abstract ** 
A compressor in hearing aid devices (HADs) is responsible
for mapping the dynamic range of input signals to the residual dynamic
range of hearing-impaired (HI) patients. Gains and parameters of
the compressor are set according to the HI patient’s preferences. In
different surroundings depending upon noise level, the patient may
seek to tune the parameters to improve performance. Traditionally,
fitting of the hearing aids is done by an audiologist using hearing
aid software and the HI patient’s opinion at a clinic. In this paper,
we propose a frequency-based multi-band compressor implemented
as a smartphone application, which can be used as an alternative
to that of the traditional HADs. The proposed solution allows the
user to tune the compression parameters for each band along with a
choice of compression speed and fitting strategy. Exploiting smartphone
processing and hardware capabilities, the application can be used for
bilateral hearing loss. The performance of this easy-to-use smartphonebased
application is compared with traditional HADs using a hearing
aid test system. Objective and subjective evaluations are also carried
out to quantify the performance.
