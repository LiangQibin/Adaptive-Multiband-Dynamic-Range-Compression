What is the application?
Purpose of the application is to make a graphical user interface with Dynamic Range Compression parameters, to give user the freedom. User can set the compression paramters for both the ear seperately according to his hearing thresholds.
User will have the freedom of changing the parameters based on their listening preferences. Application gives the choice for bilateral compression, hearing aid fitting stratergy.
